Android 2 - Using Location
Dr. Honig</br>

This project was made using Android's 'LocationActivity' example, 
demonstrating the use of location by GPS and data networks. 

What this application attempts to do is find the **exact** 
opposite location on earth in relation to your current 
location, which are called antipodal points. This is derived
simply by negating the latitudinal point and taking the
absolute value of the longitudinal point and subtracting it
from 180 degrees (you will see this in the code).

One particular point I'd like to make is that since we are 
in the Midwest, most of our antipodes are going to be in the 
middle of the Indian ocean, so the Geocoder will not be able
to map it to any particular point. But it will still give you
the point!
